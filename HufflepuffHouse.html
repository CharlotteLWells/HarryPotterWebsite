    <h1>HufflePuff</h1>
    
<p>Hufflepuff values hard-work, dedication, patience, loyalty and fair play. Its symbol is the badger. Yellow and black are its colours. Professor Sprout was the Head of Hufflepuff during 1991-1998, Sprout left the post of Head of Hufflepuff and Herbology Professor sometime before 2011 and her successor for the position of Head of Hufflepuff is unknown. The Fat Friar is its ghost. The Founder of the house was Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff relates to the element of Earth. The Hufflepuff dormitories and common room are located in the basement, near the castle's kitchens. It can be accessed by tapping the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff" and is described as being a cosy and welcoming place with yellow hangings, fat armchairs, and underground tunnels that lead to the dormitories, which have perfectly round doors, like barrel tops.

    <h2>Helga Hufflepuff</h2>     <img src="css/Hufflepuff%20cup.jpg" class="pull-right">

<p>Professor Helga Hufflepuff was a witch of Medieval times and was one of the Four Founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. While the other Founders chose to have special students, Hufflepuff accepted them all, but the students of her house are described as loyal and hard-working. It is unknown when she died. Helga's portrait remains at Hogwarts.</p>
    
    
    <h3>The Golden Cup</h3>  
    
<p>Her relic for Hufflepuff was a small golden cup it had fine detail with a badger on the front and the handles were delicate, it was taken later by Tom Riddle who turned it into a Horcrux.</p>
