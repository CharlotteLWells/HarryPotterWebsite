    <h1>Slytherin</h1>
    
 <p>Slytherin House values ambition, cunning and resourcefulness and was founded by Salazar Slytherin. Its symbol is the snake. Its colours are emerald green and silver. Professor Horace Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin during the 1997-1998 school year, Severus Snape replaced him as Head of Slytherin and potions professor when Slughorn retired for several years. The Bloody Baron is the house ghost. Slytherin relates to the element water. The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached through a bare stone wall in the dungeons. The Slytherin common room lies beneath the Black Lake. It is a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and silver lamps hanging from the ceiling.</p>

    <h2>Salazar Slytherin</h2>    <img src="css/slytherin%20locket.jpg" class="pull-right">
    
<p>Professor Salazar Slytherin was a pure-blood wizard of Medieval times. He was a parselmouth (able to speak to snakes) and skilled at Legilimency (can invade someone's mind to get information, trick the person or encourage emotions). He was one of the Four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and best friends with Godric Gryffindor. Slytherin did not trust Muggle-born students, and he expressed his opinion by proposing that they should not be accepted at Hogwarts. However, when the other Hogwarts Founders didn't agree, Slytherin created the Chamber of Secrets, keeping a Basilisk inside. He left the school soon after, never to return and died in the Middle Ages.
    
<h3>Slytherin's locket</h3>    
    
<p>Slytherin's locket was a piece of jewellery originally owened by Salazar Slytherin that became an heirloom of his family. It was a locket of heavy gold with a serpentine S in glittering green stone on the front. After descending down from Slytherin, it came into possession of pure-blood families, it then went to Borgin and Burkes shop which was then bought by a witch called Hepzibah Smith who became friends with Tom Riddle and showed him the locket. Riddle wanted the locket and two days later, Hepzibah was found dead and the locket was gone.</p>
