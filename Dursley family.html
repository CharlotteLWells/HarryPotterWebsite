        <h1>The Dursley Family</h1>             <img src="css/dursley%20family.jpg" class="pull-right">
    
    
<p>The Dursley Family is a muggle-born family (non-magic people) who are related to Harry Potter. Aunt Petunia is Harry Potter's auntie as she was sisters with his mom. Petunia found her gifted sister to be a freak and was jealous how her sister was given more attention than her. Petunia and her husband (Vernon) have their own son called Dudley who they spoil rotten. The family do not like Harry and make him sleep under the stairs cupboard.</p> 
    
<p>The Dursley hate magic and made sure that Harry didnt believe in any magic. They lied about Harry's parents death and said they died in a car crash. They never celebrated Harry's birthdays. however, on Harry's 11th birthday they are given a letter from Hogwarts which they keep getting rid of as they do not want Harry to go to Hogwarts. But the more letters they destroy the more owls keep coming to their house. Vernon gets tired of the letters and decides they should live on an island that is far away from home.</p> 
        
<p>Harry's cousin Dudley bullies Harry through most of his life until Harry's fifth year of Hogwarts when he is saved by Harry from a Dementor that randomly attacks them in the muggle world.</p>
