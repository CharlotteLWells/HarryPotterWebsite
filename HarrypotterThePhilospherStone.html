    <h1>The Philosopher Stone</h1> <img src="css/Pholosophers-Stone_PM.jpg" class="pull-right">
    
<p>"The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."
â€”An unknown book</p>
    
<p>The famed alchemist Nicolas Flamel created the only Philosopher's Stone which (in 1991) was known to exist. Flamel used the Elixir of Life made from the stone to extend his and his wife Perenelle's lifespan for over six centuries.</p>
    
<p>In 1991 the Philosopher's Stone became the target of the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort in his quest for the Elixir of Life in order to create a new body for his soul after his failed attack on Godric's Hollow, though it is unknown how Voldemort learned of the stone. Voldemort used a human host, Quirinus Quirrell, to seek it out at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where it was being held. The stone was originally stored at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in Vault 713. However, possibly suspecting a threat, Albus Dumbledore had Rubeus Hagrid retrieve the stone the very morning of an attempted robbery.</p>

<p>After that, the Stone was placed in a special chamber and guarded by several enchantments and creatures, provided by the professors at Hogwarts: Professor Sprout's web of Devil's Snare; flying keys, charmed by Filius Flitwick; a life-size board of Wizard's Chess, transfigured by Professor McGonagall; Professor Quirrell's mountain troll; Professor Snape's potion riddle; and the Mirror of Erised, placed there by Albus Dumbledore. Hagrid's massive three-headed dog, Fluffy, guarded the trap door through which the chamber lay. In order to keep them safe from Fluffy and the other obstacles, Dumbledore forbid the third-floor corridor to all students.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger suspected that the stone would be stolen. In overhearing out-of-context conversations, they believed the thief would be Hogwarts Professor Severus Snape.</p>
