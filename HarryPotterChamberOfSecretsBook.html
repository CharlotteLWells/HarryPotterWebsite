        <p>In 1992, Harry Potter spends a dreadful summer with the Dursleys. His uncle, Vernon, is now a corporate director in a drill company he works for. Harry has never received letters from his friends, Ron and Hermione ever since the start of summer.</p>

<p>On his twelfth birthday Harry is visited by Dobby, a house-elf, who warns Harry that he will be in mortal danger if he returns to Hogwarts and reveals that he intercepted all of Harry's letters to make it seem as though his friends had forgotten him, hoping Harry might then not want to return to Hogwarts. Harry ignores Dobby's warning and is determined to return. Seeing that he will have to use force, Dobby decides to destroy, by the use of a charm, a large cake that Aunt Petunia has baked for an important dinner party attended by Vernon Dursley's big boss and his wife by making it float in the air, and then dropping it on the wife of Vernon's client, Mr Mason. Vernon imprisons Harry by fitting bars onto Harry's bedroom window.</p>

<p>A few days later, Fred, George, and Ron Weasley come to his rescue in their father's enchanted Ford Anglia. After a pleasant summer together in the Weasley house, everyone gets their needed school supplies in Diagon Alley. They head to Platform 9Â¾ at King's Cross to take the Hogwarts Express back to school. To their shock, Harry and Ron are unable to enter the barrier between platforms 9 and 10 (later revealed to be Dobby's act). In desperation, they fly to Hogwarts in the car and crash into the Whomping Willow. Ron's wand is damaged and the semi-sentient car ejects them with their belongings before disappearing into the Forbidden Forest. The two of them are allowed back into school by Dumbledore and McGonagall but they are punished with detention.</p>
