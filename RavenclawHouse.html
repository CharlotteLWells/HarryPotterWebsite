    <h1>Ravenclaw</h1>
    
<p>Ravenclaw values intelligence, creativity, knowledge and wit. Its symbol is the eagle, its colours are blue and bronze. The Ravenclaw Head of House in the 1990s was Professor Flitwick. The ghost of Ravenclaw is the Grey Lady, who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the House's Founder. Ravenclaw relates to the element of Air. The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories are located in a tower on the west side of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, can be answered by non-Ravenclaws.</p>

    <h2>Rowena Ravenclaw</h2> 
        
<p>Professor Rowena Ravenclaw was a scottish witch, who lived in the early Middle Ages. She was known for her intelligence and creativity and regarded as one of the greatest withces of the age, Ravenclaw was one of the Four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with Godric, Helga and salazar, as well as the namescale of the Ravenclaw House. Ravenclaw was "beautiful yet slightly intimidating".
    
Ravenclaw died sometime in the eleventh century, after she fell fatally ill. Legend had it that a broken heart was the cause- because her daughter, Helena, had run away with her diadem.</p>
