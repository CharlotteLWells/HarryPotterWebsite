    <h1>Arthur Weasley</h1>    <img src="css/arthur%20weasley.jpg" class="pull-right">
    
 <p>Arthur Weasley was a pure-blood wizard in the employ of the Ministry of Magic, as well as a member of the second Order of the Phoenix. He was a staunch believer in the equality of all magical and Muggle folk and was the head of the Weasley family.</p>   

<p>Arthur married Molly Prewett. During the First Wizarding War, he and Molly had seven children: sons Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and Ron, as well as their daughter Ginny. He was not a member of the Order of the Phoenix during this period, and it is unknown if he was involved in any way in the First Wizarding War. At some point after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur began working for the Ministry, in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.</p>
            
            
    <h2>During the third year of Hogwarts</h2>
            
 <p>Arthur won some money in a Daily Prophet drawing and he and his family travelled to Egypt to visit his son Bill. In autumn of the same year, when Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban and was believed to be seeking Harry's death, Arthur wanted to tell Harry the truth. He discussed the matter with his wife in secret, not wanting Harry to panic. Harry, however, overheard their conversation. On Platform 9Â¾, Arthur and Harry briefly discussed what Harry had heard; while claiming to be pleased Harry was not scared, Arthur urged Harry not to go seeking Black.</p>
